## Step 1 - Key Performance Indicators

The first step is to understand the main metrics the business wants to track, depending on the companyâ€™s product, position, targets & more. Most businesses already track their key performance indicators (KPIs) already. In this example, the main KPIs can be revenue related, such as the revenue, the average order value, the order frequency...

### Revenue by Country

United Kingdom is the region that generates most of the company's revenue. For the purpose of this analysis, we will focus on UK customers.

### Monthly Revenue

![Monthly Revenue]()

The chart above shows upward trend for the revenue generated up to the November 2011 (as the December data is incomplete). Up to August 2011, the business had a monthly revenue between 400K and 600K, since then, the business has seen its revenue dramatically increase reaching 1.2M in November 2011.

![Montly Growth Rate]()

September was an outstanding months with almost 60% growth compared with the previous month. November was also very good month with 46.2% growth. March and May are both up by more than 30% but this may be explain by the poor performance of the previous months.

January and April 2011 are poor performance months. We will have to investigate the data to understand why.
